# Vuforia

1-Import and Set Up Vuforia: After importing the Vuforia SDK, follow the Vuforia setup wizard within Unity. It will guide you through the process of configuring Vuforia for your project.

2-Create a Vuforia Database: In the Vuforia developer portal, create a Vuforia database. This is where you'll configure your target images (which can include QR codes).

3-Upload and Configure the QR Code: Inside the Vuforia database, upload your QR code image as a target. Configure its size, rating, and other details as needed.

4-Download and Import the Database: Once your target is configured, download the database and import it into your Unity project.

5-Add the Image Target: In your Unity scene, add an "Image Target" game object. Configure it to use the database you imported, and select the QR code image as the target.

6-Create AR Content: Now, you can create your AR content that will appear when the QR code is recognized. This content could be 3D models, animations, or any AR elements you want to display
